### Project Overview

In this mini-course, you‚Äôll work through a series of Python exercises and code examples that cover fundamental data analytics concepts. Using a dataset containing health metrics (like sleep, hydration, and calorie intake), you‚Äôll learn how to analyze and visualize data to understand the relationships between your health habits and creativity.

This project is targeted at creatives who want to:
- Improve their health and productivity through data-informed decisions.
- Build a strong foundation in Python for data analysis. (maybe get a new job?)
- Explore how data analytics can connect with AI to optimize health and creativity.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Use **basic Python programming** concepts, such as variables, loops, and conditional statements.
- Understand and manipulate data structures like **lists** and **dictionaries**.
- Work with **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib** for data visualization.
- Calculate and interpret a **health score** based on hydration, sleep, and calorie intake.
- Visualize trends in your health data and reflect on how different factors might influence your creativity.
- Understand how foundational data analytics skills connect to **AI and machine learning**.

### Installation and Setup

To get started with this project, you‚Äôll need to set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-for-nutrition-ai.git
   cd python-for-nutrition-ai
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   It‚Äôs recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can set this up using `venv` or `conda`.

   Using `venv`:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Using `conda`:
   ```bash
   conda create --name nutrition_ai python=3.8
   conda activate nutrition_ai
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the Notebook**:
   If you're using Google Colab, you can upload the `.ipynb` notebook to your Drive or run it locally with Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Alternatively, you can open it in Google Colab by uploading the notebook file to Google Drive.

### Usage

This project includes a series of Jupyter notebooks structured for a progressive learning experience. Each notebook section contains:

1. **Code Examples**: Code blocks demonstrating Python basics, data manipulation, and visualization.
2. **Exercises**: Prompts and guided comments where you can add code to practice what you‚Äôve learned.
3. **Visualization**: Learn to create plots to analyze trends in health data and reflect on potential correlations with creativity.

**Dataset**: The main dataset used for this project includes columns like:
   - Date
   - Calories (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Snacks)
   - Sleep Score
   - Pee Times (for estimating hydration)
   - Health Score (calculated from hydration and sleep)

### Modules and Code Structure

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the main sections and code structure in the project:

1. **Basic Math and Strings**: Introduction to math operations and string manipulation in Python.
2. **Data Structures**: Using lists and dictionaries to store and manage health data.
3. **Conditional Statements**: Building logical conditions for health analysis (e.g., checking hydration goals).
4. **Loops and Functions**: Using loops to calculate total calorie intake and writing functions to compute health scores.
5. **Data Analysis with Pandas**: Loading and analyzing a CSV file containing health data.
6. **Data Visualization with Matplotlib**: Creating plots to visualize trends in health data over time.
